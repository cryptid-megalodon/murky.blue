Hi, my name is Blake Wolf.

I'm a software engineer and machine learning researcher. I previously worked at Google on Tensorflow, Youtube Music and Technical Infrastructure teams. Outside of tech, I co-founded a solar farm development company to develop sustainable energy projects. We are now developing our first solar array in California.

For fun I enjoy bike riding, board games, anime, movies, stand-up comedy, reading sci-fi and rock climbing.
